This code base is offered for the purposes of review and on the
off-chance that it might prove useful to someone.  It may be freely
used with suitable attribution. It is a snap-shot of my code base used
in producing the analyses for Progatzky et al., Regulation of
intestinal immune homeostasis and inflammatory response by enteric
glia.

This code is not being offered as a package, i.e., it is not expected
to run "out of the box".  In particular it requires some files that
are not in this repository. Chief among these is the Seurat object
which can be downloaded from GEO XXX and should be placed in
SeuratObject/SeuratObject.rds.  The code here then accesses this with
the function getSeuratObject() in SeuratWare02.R

The code here also uses several personal packages which are provided
here as .gz files.

-------------------------------------------------

- SeuratWare02.R contains basic functionality such as retrieval of the
Seurat object, names of various classifications (e.g., cell types) and
conversion between seurat_clusters and cell types (referred to as
shortNames), etc.

- Pipeline02.R  This produces basic plots and counts as well as
detecting marker genes and running various DE comparisons.  Originally
run with the RNA assay, I have also run it with the integrated assay.

- variousViolins.R makes violin plots of gene expression for various
genes, cell types and quadrants.  In each case there is a pair of
quadrants and a p-value is computed for each gene and cell type as
regards the difference in expression between the two quadrants.  The
results are recorded in violinPlots/

- Cxcr3Violins.R and PdgfraViolins.R More violin plots.

- IfngResponseGenes.R makes a similar figure for mean expression of Ifng
response genes.  gseaIfngResponse.txt contains a list of human genes
from the corresponding Hallmark gene set and these are converted to
mouse genes by mousifyIfngResponse.R and stored in
IfngResponseGenes.txt The resulting violin plot is in violinPlots/

- runTwoGenesPlots.R uses twoGenesScatterPlot.R to produce scatter plots
showing the expression of two genes in particular cell types. Figures
and counts of cells expressing the either or both genes are in
twoGeneFigures/

- getGroupMarkerGenesNoCutoff.R  This makes listings of the group
marker genes without applying a cutoff based on padj.

- LFC_for_GSEA.R makes .rnk files for gsea for the cell types and
treaments found in GSEA_cellTypes.csv.  In each case the we subset to
the treatment and cell type and look for the DE genes for WT vs KO.
We record these without thresholding in the appropriate subdirectory
of GSEA.

- fgsea.R takes these rank files and compares these against the Hallmark
pathways.  The results are saved both with and without thresholding in
the same directory as the rnk file.

- subSampledDEGenes_nCount_RNA.R uses subsampling of clusters to
eliminate cluster size when counting DE genes between two particular
quadrants (a 'comparison').  In each case the smaller quadrant and
cluster is randomly sampled to 50 genes, the larger to 100.  In
addition, we control for nCount_RNA as a latent variable.  The results
are saved to subsmapling/forSubsampling_nCount.txt

- countSubsampledDEGenes_nCount_RNA.R uses the resulting data and
produces the figure subsampling/countControlledDEGenes_nCount.pdf

- makePaperFigures01.R makes plots of counts of DE genes for various
comparisons in each of the clusters.  These are not controlled for
cluster size. The results are in paperFigures/

- makePaperFigures02.R makes a dot plot showing gene expression for each
of the genes in paperFigures/GenesForDotPlotFigure.csv for each cell
type.  Expression is shown by color, dot shows shows the percentage of
the cluster that gene is expressed in.  The result is in paperFigures/

- FranzeClusterSubplots.R subclusters several cell types we were
interested in.
